Generate Laravel Migrations from an existing database, including indexes and foreign keys!

## Upgrading to Laravel 5.4

Please note that the Laravel 4 Generator edits have been moved to `https://github.com/xethron/Laravel-4-Generators.git` to update compatibility.

## Laravel 5 installation

The recommended way to install this is through composer:

```bash
composer require --dev "xethron/migrations-generator"
```

Edit `config/app.php` and add this to providers section:

```php
Way\Generators\GeneratorsServiceProvider::class,
Xethron\MigrationsGenerator\MigrationsGeneratorServiceProvider::class,
User11001\EloquentModelGenerator\EloquentModelGeneratorProvider:class,
```
If you want this lib only for dev, you can add the following code to your `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` file, within the `register()` method:

```php
public function register()
{
    if ($this->app->environment() !== 'production') {
        $this->app->register(\Way\Generators\GeneratorsServiceProvider::class);
        $this->app->register(\Xethron\MigrationsGenerator\MigrationsGeneratorServiceProvider::class);
    }
    // ...
}
```

Notes:
* Thanks to @jamisonvalenta, you can now generate Migrations in Laravel 5!
* `feature/laravel-five-stable` was forked from `way/generators` `3.0.3` and was made Laravel `5.0` ready. Jeffrey Way has discontinued support for Laravel 5, so the other `artisan generate:` commands may not have been made `5.0` compatible.  Investigate the `artisan make:` commands for substitutes, contribute to Laravel to extend generation support, or fix it and submit a PR to `jamisonvalenta/feature/laravel-five-stable`.

## Laravel 4 installation

Run the following composer command:

```bash
composer require --dev "xethron/migrations-generator:~1.3.0"
```

Next, add the following service providers:

```php
'Way\Generators\GeneratorsServiceProvider',
'Xethron\MigrationsGenerator\MigrationsGeneratorServiceProvider',
```

And you're set. To double check if its working, run `php artisan`, and look for the command `migrate:generate`

## Usage

To generate migrations from a database, you need to have your database setup in Laravel's Config.

Run `php artisan migrate:generate` to create migrations for all the tables, or you can specify the tables you wish to generate using `php artisan migrate:generate table1,table2,table3,table4,table5`. You can also ignore tables with `--ignore="table3,table4,table5"`

Laravel Migrations Generator will first generate all the tables, columns and indexes, and afterwards setup all the foreign key constraints. So make sure you include all the tables listed in the foreign keys so that they are present when the foreign keys are created.

You can also specify the connection name if you are not using your default connection with `--connection="connection_name"`

Run `php artisan help migrate:generate` for a list of options.
